I always craved stability, but I've learned that naturalness is more important. When we solely pursue stability, we tend to focus on results rather than processes, becoming overly concerned with ensuring stable outcomes.

This can sometimes lead to poor decision-making. There's a risk of pushing projects forward unreasonably or making irrational choices just to achieve stable results.

On the other hand, pursuing naturalness makes us focus more on the process than the outcome. Naturalness in the process reduces stress and tension, enhances creativity, and helps us make better decisions.

Ultimately, a collection of natural actions creates stability, leading to a healthier and more sustainable sense of security.
