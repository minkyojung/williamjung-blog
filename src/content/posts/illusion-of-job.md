Job titles are an illusion. They are merely guidelines designed to enhance organizational productivity and facilitate communication. However, when we become overly fixated on job titles, we tend to evaluate our capabilities and limitations solely within the framework of these titles. This often leads to excessively tying our identity to our job title. For example:

> "I'm good at this, so I'm suited to be a developer, but I lack these skills, so I can't be a marketer."
> "This isn't what I wanted to do. I can't find interest in this role."

However, if we view job titles simply as 'arbitrary/strategic choices for productive work (business impact)', we can think more flexibly (working goal-oriented rather than title-oriented). Especially in early-stage teams, one person might need to perform roles across multiple job titles, and this fusion of diverse roles can sometimes create new job categories that transcend traditional boundaries.

Therefore, the definition of job titles itself doesn't hold much significance. Particularly in the early stages, teams that can work effectively without rigid title boundaries have a higher chance of success. Marty Cagan defined such teams as 'empowered product teams'. These teams can reduce communication costs in the process of creating business impact, based on their understanding of business value.

Ultimately, job titles are merely metadata for the work we perform, not elements that define us, but rather dependent variables of our work. I once read an article describing today's society as one where 'it's hard to employ and hard to be employed'. That's why we should focus on becoming 'empowered product people'.
