A few weeks ago, I wrote about the "The illusion of job titles," and many makers resonated with the idea. This widespread agreement reflects a common reality in startups: people often perform multiple roles simultaneously, regardless of their specific field or aptitude. 

My team, Disquiet, we use the title "Operator" to describe this versatile role. I remember a co-founder of a unicorn company once looking at my business card and remarking, "Your job title is basically 'does everything'!"


## The Discomfort of Constant Beginnings
A universal experience for those working in startups is the need to continually learn new things. We repeatedly find ourselves as beginners, absorbing new information, applying it, and growing through the process. For instance:

- Today, we might learn no-code to build a product
- Tomorrow, we study content creation to develop product promotional materials
- The day after, we delve into Go-to-Market (GTM) strategies to launch our product

If this process is successful and leads to customer acquisition, we might need more resources to maintain the product. Then:

- Someone starts learning about recruitment, facing the inevitable trial and error
- Another team member meets fellow entrepreneurs to gather IR (Investor Relations) tips
- Someone else studies bootstrapping cases to understand how to run a business without external funding

However, at least in Korean society, being in a position of "not knowing something well" can be uncomfortable. This discomfort often leads people to fear being a beginner and to seek out only what's familiar.

## Are All-Rounders Ideal for Early-Stage Teams?
The answer to this question is both yes and no. The affirmative part comes from the fact that having a wealth of knowledge and experience reduces the time needed for exploration and allows for more intuitive decision-making. However, the other crucial factor is whether one is comfortable with the feeling of being a beginner.

A person comfortable with being a beginner is someone who:
- Has experience starting from scratch in various fields multiple times
- Is familiar with the feeling of "not knowing something well"
- Can adapt quickly and learn in new situations without being overly intimidated

These individuals view failure as part of the learning process. They understand that when venturing into unknown territory, failure is possible, and the key is to extract valuable lessons from these experiences. They don't dwell on failures but instead focus on the joy of learning.

## How to Move Beyond Being a Novice: Imitation
So, how should one act in a beginner's situation? I highly recommend finding a role model and practicing imitation. For effective imitation, consider the following:

#### Identify Clear Patterns to Learn
Don't try to imitate everything
Focus on specific 'patterns' like decision-making processes or daily routines


#### Find Suitable Role Models
Simply imitating "industry celebrities" can be a mistake
Look for role models whose temperament aligns with yours
Imitate in a way that maximizes your own strengths



## We're All Beginners
Even Kevin Systrom, the founder of Instagram, has expressed feeling pressure and difficulty when starting a new venture after a previous success. Ultimately, we all live in a cycle of 'novice > expert > novice'. The key is to recognize this fact and consider how to learn quickly and enjoyably in new situations.

Success in startups depends on continuous learning and adaptability. Don't fear new challenges; instead, embrace the mindset of a beginner and keep growing. Remember, in the dynamic world of startups, being comfortable with constant learning and adapting to new roles is not just an assetâ€”it's a necessity.Last edited just now
