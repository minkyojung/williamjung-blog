A few days ago, I read a very impactful newsletter and decided to share it with you. While I thought about summarizing it for those who are busy, I felt it would be better for you to read the full text, even if it takes some time. Especially for those who struggle with making decisions, I think you'll find it useful.

> An intelligent person is able to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function" - F. Scott Fitzgerald, "The Crack-Up", Esquire, 1936.

I read this quote in high school, and at some point, it became a compass for my thinking. If I had to summarize my life in one phrase, it would be 'constant revision of thoughts.' The fact that I don't know what I don't know scares me. This fear, especially when I feel I'm right or get deeply engrossed in something, prompts me to thoroughly re-examine my beliefs and thoughts.
In this piece, I've summarized 10 ways to think clearly in a complex world.


## 1. All inquiry begins with curiosity
School has conditioned us not to think and imagine freely. It has made us seek answers first. However, the history of thought continuously highlights thinkers who, instead of succumbing to the urge to conclude, danced along the edges of understanding. Conclusions and answers can make us feel good momentarily, but the true joy of thinking emerges when we savor the pleasure of curiosity over years as we chew over a single question.


## 2. The first opinion on any subject is always incomplete
These days, social media makes us feel the need to express opinions quickly; this makes us feel part of the conversation. However, to truly understand something, sometimes it's necessary to sit quietly and wait. This way, you can take in new information and come to a different conclusion than your initial thought. 

Of course, expressing our opinions is important, but acknowledging that our thoughts could be wrong is even more crucial. This open-mindedness helps in thinking more clearly.


## 3. Be cautious of generalizations
Flawed thinking and defective opinions share one common trait: they are often too abstract and generalized to handle complex problems. Such broad generalizations can be momentarily intriguing, but really good thinking asks, 

> But what about this case?

This question urges us to think through possible scenarios and work to ensure we have the maximum number of choices. Reaching 100% thorough ideas isn't possible, but this practice helps us recognize depth and complexity in seemingly simple questions, leading to better decision-making.

## 4. The first reading is always misinterpreted
Every time I reread a book, I am always surprised at how much I misunderstood during the first read. When we first gain insight from a book, it's easy to flaunt our intellect and draw conclusions based on first impressions. However, age and experience quickly refute these initial conclusions, making space for more nuanced interpretation and moderate understanding. 

There is always a deeper meaning in books that a first read cannot capture. When dealing with sufficiently complex books, always keep in mind that you might have read them wrong.

## 5. Confusion breeds good ideas
The post-modern era abhors ambiguity. We want everything to be clear, understandable, and easy to grasp from the get-go. However, better thinking always emerges after a prolonged period of confusion. During this period, the mind extends beyond its comfort zone, adapting to unfamiliar thoughts. Instead of viewing chaos as something to avoid, embrace it and trust that this chaos won't last forever. Eventually, as your mind acclimates to the increasing complexity, a new order of thinking will open up.

## 6. The brain generates meaningless thoughts
The mind is a nonsense generator convincing itself it's not. The thoughts we nourish always seem deeper, truer, and more righteous than others. In extreme cases, madness appears when we refuse external opinions that could correct our thoughts. To overcome this, I like to share my ideas with friends and trusted people to ensure I'm not completely on the wrong path.

## 7. Sometimes you may not know what you truly believe
In our information age, it's easy to borrow beliefs without deeply thinking about them. Pretending to believe in something to appear more virtuous, righteous, or altruistic is the quickest way to avoid self-reflection. 

Sometimes, after a long period of self-reflection, we might discover that we actually resonate with outdated, antiquated, and foolish ideas. Admitting this is the first step to correcting those wrong thoughts instead of letting them fester under the guise of false virtue.

## 8. Sometimes you may not know what you truly believe
Take note that when we are angry at someone or something, we never point the finger back at ourselves. We are too busy creating reasons why the other party is wrong and we are unquestionably right. The mature approach is to consider that we might be wrong.

Here, whether you are right or wrong isn't important. The point is to keep an open mind, get accustomed to contrary viewpoints, and sometimes stepping back can help a great deal.

## 9. Do not engage in a debate simply to prove a point
Debates can be fun but can easily be mistaken for deep thinking. It's easy to get caught up in endless arguments just to prove you're right. In contrast, careful contemplation causes self-contradiction, confusion, and mistakes, but ultimately helps reach practical ideas.

## 10. Always base theories on reality
Scholars often fall into the trap of living in an abstract world, frustrated by the lack of real-life outcomes. Some theories are impressive and elaborate but completely irrelevant to everyday life, making reading them a total waste of time. 

However, a good theory directly changes our perception of everyday life and influences our behavior. Instead of getting lost in technical details, ask how a theory impacts aspects of your life and ground it in your experience. Ideally, theory and practice should complement each other because leaning too far in either direction tends to lead to foolish conclusions.
